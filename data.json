You plan on rockin' something fierce?\n(Zaakir)\nOh am I\nZaakir's the name, the A.K.A Soup-ah\nThe verbal acupuncture from the dope old-schooler\nI used to be the bubble for other that used to come on\nNow they be the lovers of brothers they can't front on\nPut me in the mix LP 12-inch\nSP the elegant poetic pestilence\nI'm carbonated the anti-confederated\nHighly commemorated and the most celebrated\nFor connecting it word verb subject to the predicate\nPlus I got the etiquette to keep it moving\nAnd showing cats how it's done\nCause' it's the verbal combat position number one\n\n(Mark 7even)\nWe keep it beaming like a beacon\nIf it's lyrics that you're seeking\nWhether black or Puerto Rican\nPeople back us when we're speaking\nWe got the kinda rhymes to get ya ready for the weekend\n(Jurassic 5)\nTo the mass amount of legions that came for party pleasing\n(Mark 7even)\nOur temperature is freezing all kinds of different regions\nThe rhythm is the reason you're checking for what we've done\nPlease, son, our thesis will rip your crew in pieces\nYour rhymes ain't ripe, homeboy you ain't in season\n\nMy quality control captivates your party patrol\nYour mind-body-and-soul\nFor whom the bell tolls let the rhythm explode\nBig bad and bold B-Boys of old\n\n(Chalie 2na)\nWell it's the angelic man relic Klan repellant\nMy planned parent manuscripts withstand bullets\nFlashing like a Japan tourist we command pure hits\nWhile you cramming to understand these contraband lyrics\nMy fam submits to pray five times a day\nClimbing into your mind with live rhyme display\nJ-Five finds a way to remain supreme\nComing verbally Hardison as if my name was Kadeem\n\n(Akil)\nAyo my team dream works without Spielbergs or spill words\nCommunicate from the Earth throughout the universe\nI transmit transcripts transcontinental lyrics\nDeeply rooted in your spirits\nI love the power of words nouns and verbs\nThe pen and the sword linguistic art of war\nNo folklores or myths in my penmanship\nThe Pather Scholar Warriors is what I present\nVerbally decapitating those against\nJa ha, veesee ee vee lee la\nNow my words make sense\nYou gots-ta get up on your vocab\n(Jurassic 5)\nYou gots-ta have vocab\n(Akil)\nLetters make words and sentences makes paragraphs\n\n(Zakir)\nI make the pen capsize like the verbal with the planted eyes\nPlanning knives with every pair that I utilise\nI Spit juice crack blood from your tooth\nInflict truths speak Allahs ninety-nine attributes\n\n(Chalie 2na)\nYou baby MCs drink Pedialyte\nWhile underground doesn't like you the media might\nBut we the elite will change that\nAs we bridge gaps in this lyrical grudge-match\nBrothers we slug back\n\n(Mark 7even)\nWe bless tracks with the help of a raw rap\nImprint it like paw tracks all over your brain-wrap\nMy mental maneuver will clear and steer right through ya\nWe grand like Poobah understand that we move ya\n\n(Akil)\nMy rhythm reveals roller-coaster real deal\nRevolutionise we active build\nI plant my dreams in the field and wait to harvest my skills\nFor the starving MC hungry trying to get tha meal\n\nMy quality control captivates your party patrol\nYour mind-body-and-soul\nFor whom the bell tolls let the rhythm explode\nBig bad and bold B-Boys of old"}
